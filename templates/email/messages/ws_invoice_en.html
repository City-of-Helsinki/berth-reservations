    The City of Helsinki’s boat berths are leased out to customers until further
    notice, and an annual fee is charged for them in accordance with the currently
    valid price list. If the invoice is not paid by the due date, the lease is
    terminated automatically. The boating season is from 10 June to 14 September,
    during which boats are allowed to be kept at berths.
